# ML Price Detection Project

This repository contains a machine learning project for price prediction using housing data.

## Project Overview

This project implements a supervised machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features. The model is trained on housing data and can be used for price prediction tasks.

## Files Description

- **`housing.names`**: Dataset description file containing information about the features used in the model
- **`housing_model.joblib`**: Trained machine learning model saved in joblib format
- **`Model Usage.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to use the trained model
- **`Pricepred.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the price prediction implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- jupyter

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib jupyter
```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the model:
   - `Pricepred.ipynb` - Contains the main price prediction implementation
   - `Model Usage.ipynb` - Shows how to use the trained model

2. Load the trained model:
```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('housing_model.joblib')
```

3. Make predictions using the loaded model.

## Model Information

The model is trained on housing data and can predict prices based on various housing features. Check the `housing.names` file for detailed information about the features used in the model.
